It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

      "\n",
      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is addressing the nation, reflecting on his 5-year tenure as President of India and expressing gratitude to everyone who has supported him. He shares 10 key messages that he learned during his interactions with people from various walks of life, including politics, science, academia, and more. He emphasizes the importance of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development, particularly through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Focusing on agriculture, citing the \"Seed to Food\" program as a backbone for growth.\n",
      "4. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage.\n",
      "5. Defending the nation and its pride.\n",
      "6. Promoting youth movement for a Developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He acknowledges the question as thoughtful and assures her that he will work towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, called it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and providing physical connectivity through quality roads to enable the faster movement of products from villages to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which involves providing urban amenities in rural areas (PURA) complex to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with active support from the government. The speaker believes that empowering villages and providing connectivity can lead to transformation in the 600,000 villages of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, where villagers are engaged in activities such as Jatropha and herbal plant cultivation, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts from JETRO. The project has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers and has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide by establishing similar PURA projects across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. The first is from meeting over 6000 farmers at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of agriculture in the country's economy and the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources. They believe that with the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries, the nation can achieve an agricultural GDP growth of at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is from a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was smiling and confident. When asked what he wanted, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker is inspired by Krishna Murthy's positivity and confidence, and the experience has given them a sense of hope and motivation to defeat problems and succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker recalls a person with physical challenges who, despite his limitations, has a latent talent for music. He sang beautifully in front of the speaker, and it was a touching moment. The message is that with a positive attitude, perseverance, and support from parents, teachers, and others, people with disabilities can overcome their challenges and share their talents with others.\n",
      "2. The speaker shares their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu and Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. The villagers, including school children, had lost a lot, but they were resilient and grateful for the help they received from the Army, Air Force, and state government. Despite their struggles, the villagers had become masters of their problems, rather than allowing them to control their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is about overcoming challenges and finding ways to give back to others, even in the face of disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by a leader or dignitary, possibly the Prime Minister of India, who is speaking about the resilience and courage of Indian citizens, particularly children and villagers, in the face of natural disasters and calamities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recounts two specific instances: one where children and villagers in a Jammu & Kashmir village bravely participated in a relief operation with the Armed Forces and another where they witnessed the participation of the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and state government authorities in providing relief grants to earthquake victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions a personal experience in 2005 when they visited the Car Nicobar Islands, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children who had lost loved ones in the 2004 Tsunami. Despite their suffering, the islanders had taken in affected victims as their own and showed remarkable courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then recites a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which expresses the idea that God has given humans the courage to challenge the forces of nature and that with divine guidance, they will succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions a speech they gave to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a proposed project called the \"Pan African e-Network\" aimed at connecting 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections, estimated to cost $100 million. The project will connect:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where Indian specialists are providing an MBA course to Ethiopian students and tele-medicine services to local hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by someone of high authority, likely the Prime Minister of India, and it highlights several achievements and initiatives in various fields. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The speaker mentions a tele-consultation project between Hyderabad and Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which has been providing live consultations in cardiology and radiology since 2006.\n",
      "* The speaker expresses pride in India's ability to bring technological benefits to people, particularly in Africa, and notes that this collaboration has led to societal transformation in the African continent.\n",
      "* The speaker then shifts focus to India's defense forces, mentioning their bravery and dedication to duty. The speaker highlights three memorable experiences they had with the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, including a visit to the Siachen Glacier, an underwater journey in an INS Sindhurakshak, and a flight in a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet.\n",
      "* The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of Indian citizens.\n",
      "* Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens. The speaker met with a group of young citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They highlight the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, including those from the Medak district, in partnership with the district administration. The training has reportedly had a positive impact on the students, including increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. The speaker also shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who helped her father quit smoking after participating in the training. The speaker concludes that empowering India's 540 million youth, who are the most powerful resource on the earth, requires value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also promoting economic growth and development. The speaker notes that India has made significant progress in the past 60 years and has a strong foundation to become a developed nation by 2020. They express confidence in the country's youth, who are eager to contribute to the nation's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key goals for achieving a developed India by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Fostering harmony between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Providing education with a strong value system to all meritorious students, without discrimination\n",
      "5. Becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a message of hope and optimism, encouraging citizens to work together to achieve these goals and make India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker envisions a future where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Everyone has access to the best healthcare\n",
      "* The government is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the last five years. He shares his mission to bridge the gap between diverse hearts and minds in India's multicultural society, instilling confidence that \"we can do it\". He reaffirms his commitment to making India a developed nation by 2020 and concludes with a blessing from God.\n",
